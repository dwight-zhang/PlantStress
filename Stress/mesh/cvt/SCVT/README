The SCVT package is used to generate the Spherical Centroid Voronoi Tessellation 
[1] on the unit sphere. It is only for educational use.

It consists of the following files:
***************************************************************************
  scvt_ini.f  (Generate the inital SCVT generators using Monte Carlo method
               according to the given density function)
  scvt_opt.f  (Generate the SCVT mesh using Lloyd's method)
  grid_ref.f  (Refine the SVT method by adding middle generators on edges)
  draw_diag.f (Draw the spherical Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation)
  density.f   (Define the density for generators distribution)
  randgen.f   (Random point generator on the unit sphere)
  process.f   (Process the SVDT information and generate output file)
  svtgen.f    (Spherical Voronoi Tessellation generator for given generators
               which is a part of "STRIPACK" package [2])
  scvt.in     (input file)
  scvt.m      (variable files)

Sample output generators files:
  scvt_12.dat scvt_42.dat scvt_162.dat scvt_642.dat scvt_2562.dat

*****How to run it*****
0. Preprocess 
   -- Define a density function in "density.f", see the sample density 
      functions defined there.
   -- Compile
      %make

1. Edit the "scvt.in" file
   -- The 2nd row is the number of generators/nodes "n"
   -- The 4th row is the maximal number of iterations "max_iter" for Lloyd's 
      algorithm.
   -- The 6th row is the tolerance set for Lloyd's method (eps)
   -- The 8th row is whether we place one node at the poles?
      (0-->no  -1-->south  1-->North)
   -- See the sample "scvt.in" file included in the package
   -- The Stride number means a re-triangulation is done after Stride-steps of iterations.

2. Generate the initial SCVT generators using Monte Carlo method according
   to the density function
   %scvt_ini
     -- It reads "scvt.in" for number of generators 
     -- The output generators are saved in "scvt_mc.dat"

3. Generate the SCVT using Lloyd's method 
   %cp scvt_mc.dat scvt_s.dat
   %scvt_opt
     -- It reads "scvt.in" and takes "scvt_s.dat" as the input file for
        initial positions of generators
     -- The output generators are saved in "scvt_lloyd.dat"
     -- The output SCVT mesh information is saved in "voronoi.dat"
     -- The ouput spherical delaunay triangulation information is saved in 
        "deltri.dat"

4. Draw the SCVT and SDT
   %cp scvt_lloyd.dat nodes.dat
   %draw_diag
     -- It takes "nodes.dat" as the input file for positions of generators
     -- The output SCVT diagram is saved in "voronoi.eps"
     -- The output SDT diagram is saved in "deltri.eps"

5. Refine the spherical meshes
   %cp scvt_lloyd.dat nodes_s.dat
   %grid_ref
     -- It takes "nodes_s.dat" as the input file for starting generators
     -- The output for ending generators is saved in "nodes_e.dat"
